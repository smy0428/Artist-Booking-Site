Fyyur
-----

### Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

I built the data models using microframwork Flask with python to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues.

### Overview

This app started out with the front end and was only missing one thing… real data! It was missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. Now it is a fully functioning site that is capable of doing the following, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.
